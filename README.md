# Terraform Modules for Monitoring Stack Deployment

This repository contains reusable Terraform modules for deploying various components of a monitoring stack on a Kubernetes cluster. Each module is designed to deploy a specific service (such as Prometheus, Jaeger, Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana, Alertmanager) using Helm charts or other deployment methods.

## Folder Structure

The `terraform-modules` directory contains the following subdirectories, each representing a Terraform module for a specific monitoring or observability service:

```plaintext
terraform-modules/
├── prometheus/               # Module for deploying Prometheus
├── jaeger/                   # Module for deploying Jaeger
├── elasticsearch/            # Module for deploying Elasticsearch
├── logstash/                 # Module for deploying Logstash
├── kibana/                   # Module for deploying Kibana
└── alertmanager/             # Module for deploying Alertmanager
```

Each module directory contains the following files and folders:

- **`main.tf`**: The main Terraform configuration file for deploying the service. This file contains the resource definitions and configurations for deploying the Helm chart or service in Kubernetes.
- **`variables.tf`**: Defines the input variables required for the module. These variables make the module configurable and allow users to customize the deployment according to their requirements.

- **`outputs.tf`**: Specifies the outputs that the module will expose. Outputs typically include information like service endpoints, credentials, or other relevant deployment details.

- **`README.md`**: Documentation file that explains how to use the module, the purpose of the module, inputs, outputs, and any other relevant details.

- **`examples/`**: Contains example Terraform configurations (`example.tf`) demonstrating how to use the module. These examples provide a quick start for users to understand the module's usage.

- **`scripts/`**: A directory to store any helper scripts (e.g., shell scripts) that might be needed for the module's functionality, such as initialization or cleanup tasks.

- **`templates/`**: A directory to store template files, like Helm values files or YAML templates, that are required by the module for deployment customization.

## Modules Overview

### 1. **Prometheus Module**

- **Description**: Deploys Prometheus using Helm charts for monitoring and alerting in a Kubernetes cluster.
- **Usage**: Refer to the `prometheus/README.md` file for detailed usage instructions and examples.

### 2. **Jaeger Module**

- **Description**: Deploys Jaeger for distributed tracing in a Kubernetes environment.
- **Usage**: Refer to the `jaeger/README.md` file for detailed usage instructions and examples.

### 3. **Elasticsearch Module**

- **Description**: Deploys Elasticsearch for log storage and search capabilities.
- **Usage**: Refer to the `elasticsearch/README.md` file for detailed usage instructions and examples.

### 4. **Logstash Module**

- **Description**: Deploys Logstash for data processing and transformation before sending logs to Elasticsearch.
- **Usage**: Refer to the `logstash/README.md` file for detailed usage instructions and examples.

### 5. **Kibana Module**

- **Description**: Deploys Kibana for data visualization and analysis of logs stored in Elasticsearch.
- **Usage**: Refer to the `kibana/README.md` file for detailed usage instructions and examples.

### 6. **Alertmanager Module**

- **Description**: Deploys Alertmanager to handle alerts sent by Prometheus and manage alert notifications.
- **Usage**: Refer to the `alertmanager/README.md` file for detailed usage instructions and examples.

## Getting Started

To use these modules in your Terraform configuration:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd terraform-modules
   ```

2. **Initialize Terraform**: Run `terraform init` in the directory where your Terraform configuration files are located to initialize the provider plugins.

3. **Use the Modules**: Import the required module in your Terraform configuration. For example, to use the Prometheus module:

   ```hcl
   module "prometheus" {
     source = "./terraform-modules/prometheus"
     # Additional configuration parameters
   }
   ```

4. **Apply the Configuration**: Run `terraform apply` to deploy the services in your Kubernetes cluster.
